So this is the final project for Patika - Solana practicum.

Hey there, this is Merto. With this project, i aimed for simple but effective program. 
*Absolutely it's not because i have lack of tech info and have limited time xd*

My life has always about "Chewing Glass" in many ways. And as a 25 years old human being, now i figured out that i kinda, like it?
Talking is hard. So is the turst. With the concept of "trustless", i think the revolution of the blockchain is gonna be historical one for humanity.
When i feel depressed, i always head out to the r/Depressed or r/SuicideWatch to look up peoples problem, and tryna help them. With the experiences that i gained from theese subreddits, i can say that people are getting comfortable when they talk. Even if you do not get any respond, writing things down and letting people aware of it, really helps to cure depression.

So in this DaPP, you can let your inner problems go with the 'trustless' environment of blockchain technology. Or you can motivate people with your words. It's up to you.
